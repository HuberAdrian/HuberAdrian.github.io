## Project in Development

**[Project is prostponed until Sep 25 when we get new lab equipment at our university]**

I'm currently working on research and development of a quantum-enhanced inertial navigation system. This project explores how quantum sensors can provide precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) independently of GPS.

### Project Goals

- Investigate quantum-enhanced inertial measurement units (QIMUs)
- Explore applications for GPS-denied environments
- Study technical challenges in transitioning from laboratory demonstrations to field-deployable hardware

I'll be sharing more details, technical specifications, and results here in the coming months.
