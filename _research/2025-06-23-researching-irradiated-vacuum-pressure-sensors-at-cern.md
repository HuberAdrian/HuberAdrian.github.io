## Brief Description

I was fortunate to be accepted as a summer research student at the biggest particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva. Besides all the other events, lectures and all kind of activities, my main project was to investigate how some new vacuum pressure sensors behave once they are exposed to radiation. Due to the radiation inside the LHC, the sensors are prone to have a short lifetime. Especially now with the High Luminosity era, the radiation exposure is even higher. There exist radiation tolerant pressure sensors, although they are extremely expensive. But out of necessity they are used anyway. I was given a new type of sensors that cost only a fraction, but the reaction to radiation is unknown.

### **Project still ongoing until 12. September 2025. Once the final report is published, I will add it here**

## Presentation

Halfway through my project, I had to present my current progress in front of the Experimental Physics department. Here are the slides from that talk:
