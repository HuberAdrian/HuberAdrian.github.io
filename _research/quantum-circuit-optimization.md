## Introduction

Quantum circuit optimization is a crucial step in the development of practical quantum algorithms. As quantum hardware continues to improve but remains limited by noise and decoherence, optimizing circuits to reduce depth and gate count becomes increasingly important.

### Previous Work

Traditional approaches to quantum circuit optimization have focused on:

1. Local optimization of adjacent gates
2. Template-based substitution methods
3. Phase polynomial simplification

## Our Approach

We introduce a novel technique based on group theory that identifies global transformation patterns across the entire circuit. The key insight is to represent quantum operations as elements of symmetry groups and identify composite operations that can be simplified.

### Mathematical Formulation

For a quantum circuit with unitary operations $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$, we can represent the complete operation as:

$$
U = U_n U_{n-1} \ldots U_2 U_1
$$

Our approach identifies subgroups within the sequence that combine to form simpler operations:

$$
U_j U_{j-1} \ldots U_i \approx V_k V_{k-1} \ldots V_1
$$

Where the $V$ sequence requires fewer gates or shallower depth than the original $U$ sequence.

## Results

I tested this approach on several common quantum algorithms:

</div>

The results show an average gate reduction of 27% across all tested algorithms, with particularly strong results for algorithms with high symmetry, such as quantum Fourier transform variants.

## Conclusion

This group-theoretic approach to quantum circuit optimization provides significant improvements over existing methods, particularly for circuits with inherent symmetry properties. Future work will focus on integrating these techniques with machine learning approaches to identify non-obvious symmetry patterns.
